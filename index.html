        <h1>Tesla recalls more than 1.6 million cars in China over steering software issues</h1>
       
        <h2>Tesla is recalling more than 1.6 million vehicles in China over issues with steering software and door-locking systems, the country's regulator says.</h2>

            The recall includes its models S, X, 3 and Y, and 7,538 imported vehicles.

            <b>The problems will be fixed by remote updates to software, meaning the vehicles will not need to be taken to dealerships or garages.</b>

            It comes less than a month after Tesla recalled two million cars in the US due to autopilot software issues.

            In May last year, the <b>Chinese regulator</b> said more than a million vehicles may have acceleration and braking system issues.

            The American electric car giant then discovered problems with assisted driving functions and door-locking systems.

            The Chinese regulator, the State <blockquote>Administration</blockquote> for Market Regulation (SAMR), described the planned vehicle update as a recall, even though it will happen remotely.
